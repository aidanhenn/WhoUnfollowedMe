# Find out who doesn't follow you back on Instagram

###### 1.) Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920) and follow the steps to download your instagram data. Make sure you choose the JSON format!

###### 2.) Instagram will send you an Email of your data, download this folder and find the folder called "followers_and_following" 

###### 3.) Inside that folder there will be the files "followers.json" and "following.json". Create a new folder and save these 2 files in it.

###### 4.) Open the new folder with your two files in an IDE. Create a new file and call it main.js, copy the code from the main.js file in this repo into it.

###### 5.) Run main.js and the console will display all the people who don't follow you back.

###### **Note: I added two files called followers.json and following.json into this repo to show you how the program works if you just want to test it out.**
