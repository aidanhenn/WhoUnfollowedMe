        "share_text": "NASAL BREATHING TO IMPROVE FACIAL STRUCTURE & REDUCE AGING-RELATED AESTHETIC CHANGES \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n-\nRecently I was a guest on Flagrant Podcast hosted by @andrewschulz and team. We discussed a lot of topics including human mating dynamics, peptides, emerging therapeutics for mental health, and nasal breathing which has been shown by researchers at Stanford and elsewhere to improve health at the level of cognitive function, and can also dramatically improve facial aesthetics. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a book from my colleagues @stanford on this topic entitled Jaws: A hidden epidemic, which describes how eating too many soft foods and being a mouth breather can dramatically worsen facial aesthetics. \n-\nBasically the idea is to nasal breathe whenever possible. You can train yourself to do this during sleep by putting some medical tape on your mouth before sleep or you can train yourself to be a nasal breather most of the time by doing some of your cardiovascular training strictly through nasal breathing. It takes a little bit of practice to get used to \u00e2\u0080\u0094- and does not mean you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mouth breathe at other times or during intense cardio or weight training.  One thing is for certain, both in children and adults switching to being predominantly a nasal breather is excellent for mental and physical health. Also keep in mind that sleep apnea is a dangerous condition. Switching to being a nasal breather can assist there as well.\n-\nTo hear the full conversation with @andrewschulz @akaashsingh @alexxmedia and @markygagnon search \u00e2\u0080\u009cflagrant, Huberman, Schulz\u00e2\u0080\u009d on YouTube or apple or Spotify etc. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wild one and we cover a lot of topics not covered on any other podcasts. Thank you Andrew and team for hosting me!\n-\nPlease put your questions in the comments section below this post and as always, thank you for your interest in science!\n-\n@stanford.med @stanford @nihgov @nimhgov @nih_nccih @societyforneuroscience @cellpress @andrewschulz @akaashsingh @alexxmedia @markygagnon \n-\n#neuroscience #science #ciencia #neurociencia #neuroplasticity #breathe #breath #mouth #nose #face #aesthetic #teeth #tools #learn",
