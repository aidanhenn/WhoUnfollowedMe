Last year was my first time doing triple and I managed to jump 12.96m but my technique is pretty horrible. I was hoping you could give me some tips to help me add a few inches. I have a big meet at Boston University in two weeks and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping to break into the 13\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Any help would be much appreciated!!"
